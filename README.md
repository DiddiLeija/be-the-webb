# Be the Webb!

_Become the James Webb telescope for a day!_

This is the submission for the **NASA Space Apps Challenge 2022**, under the
["Learning Through the Looking Glass"](https://2022.spaceappschallenge.org/challenges/2022-challenges/through-the-looking-glass)
challenge. This project represented the
[**Universe Gaming**](https://2022.spaceappschallenge.org/challenges/2022-challenges/through-the-looking-glass/teams/universe-gaming)
team, whose members created this game (see [below](#creators)).

## Description

> A space image is observed, and the user must focus on the image that's being seen (using the W and S keys).
> It's simple to use and very practical for young people to enter the world of astronomy. We use the Python
> programming language and the Pygame library to develop the game.

As pointed above, this game was created with Python and [Pygame](https://pygame.org). You can play it locally using Python (3.7+)
and the latest Pygame version.
