# Image bank

These are the current images we use for the game.

## How are they organized?

The files are named `image_[number].png`, where `[number]` is a number from 1 to 6.
When a file has the number 1, it's the clearest (usually the original image). If it has
the 6, it's the most blurred image.

## Original sources of the current images
